It's a free, open-source software that lets you create and manage virtual machines (VMs) and containers on your own hardware. So instead of having to buy separate computers for each project or experiment, you can create multiple virtual machines on one physical computer.</p> <p>This means you can experiment with different operating systems, software configurations, and network setups without worrying about messing up your main computer or having to buy new hardware every time. It's like having a playground for your computer, where you can try out different things and see what works best for you.</p> <p>Proxmox has a web-based interface that's easy to use, so you don't have to be a computer wizard to get started. You can create, start, stop, and delete virtual machines with just a few clicks. You can also monitor their performance and resource usage, which is pretty cool.</p> <p>Proxmox is also highly customizable and flexible, so you can use it in a lot of different ways. You can create a virtualized environment for gaming, web development, network testing, or just about anything else you can think of. Plus, it's free, so you don't have to worry about breaking the bank.</p> <p>Overall, Proxmox is a really cool tool for computer geeks who want to experiment with different things and learn more about virtualization. It's like having a secret lab where you can play around with all kinds of technology without anyone else knowing. So if you're into that kind of thing, you should definitely check it out.</p> <p>I use Proxmox to avoid having to physically go into my garage where I have most of my computing described in the Hardware section, this way I have a nice looking UI where I can provision VM's for any purpose that I need.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"general/proxmox/#_1","title":"Proxmox","text":""},{"location":"infrastructure/ansible/","title":"Ansible","text":"<p>Ansible is my go-to solution for provisioning hosts on both virtual machines and bare-metal machines. With Ansible, I can easily automate the installation of software, set up my preferred environment, and streamline the management of my applications.</p> <p>One of the key benefits of using Ansible is the ability to automate software installation after booting up machines. This saves a considerable amount of time and effort, and allows me to focus on more important tasks.</p> <p>In addition, I use Ansible to install my shell environment with customizations such as aliases. This is easily achieved through a playbook, and ensures that my shell is set up exactly how I like it.</p> <p>When it comes to managing containers, Ansible is invaluable. I can provision and configure a bunch of containers on my backup-server with minimal effort, ensuring that my applications are deployed and managed seamlessly.</p> <p>Overall, Ansible is a powerful and versatile tool that allows me to automate a wide range of tasks, from provisioning hosts to managing applications. It's an essential part of my toolkit as a system administrator, and helps me to stay productive and efficient.</p>"},{"location":"infrastructure/terraform/","title":"Terraform","text":""}]}
