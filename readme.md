## :book:&nbsp; Overview

This is the repository that hosts the code that I use to manage my home infrastructure.

I use **Debian 12**  as my base OS and **k3s** as my Kubernetes distribution. [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is used to provision the [k3s](https://k3s.io) cluster along with some basic debugging tooling on the nodes and to provision my `backup-server`.
After the kubernetes cluster is provisioned I use [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/) to watch this repository, and [Renovate](https://renovate.io/) to automatically update the dependencies.

## :wrench:&nbsp; Tools

_Below are some of the tools I find useful_
